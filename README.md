UI Consistency and Visual Appeal
This project aims to maintain a consistent user interface (UI) throughout all steps to enhance the visual appeal and ensure a pleasant user experience. Emphasis is placed on proper alignment of elements for a cohesive and professional appearance.

Retrieving and Manipulating Elements
The getElementById method is employed to retrieve the target div element. This fetched element is then stored in a variable, facilitating further manipulation and enhancing ease of use.

Styling Modifications
1. Change Background Color
The background color of the fetched div element is modified to yellow, enhancing its visual presence.

2. Add Margin
A margin of 20 pixels is incorporated into the element, providing spacing and improving overall layout.

3. Apply Padding
A padding of 10 pixels is applied to the element, contributing to its internal spacing and overall aesthetics.

4. Change Font Size
The font size is adjusted to 18 pixels, ensuring optimal readability and visual balance.

5. Set Font Weight
The font weight is set to bold, emphasizing the text and making it stand out.

6. Change Height
The height of the element is adjusted to 200 pixels, contributing to the overall structure and visual flow.

7. Modify Width
The width of the element is modified to 300 pixels, ensuring proper spatial distribution and alignment within the UI.

Feel free to integrate these styling modifications into your project as per your design preferences. Ensure the consistent use of variable names and IDs for a seamless implementation tailored to your specific requirements.
